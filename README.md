# Python Assignment 1



# How different can dimensions of a 'box' be when the volume is unchanged? 
# To get a better understanding and feel we will make a series of 5 large outdoor sculptures, each being a rectangular prism made out of rolled steel faces. 
# This program will help us determine the exact dimensions we need for each sculpture so that they are consistent in volume.

# Step 1: Input the volume variable, followed by lengths B and C, allowing both intergers and floating numbers.
# Step 2: Output length A as a floating number.
# Step 3: Ask to start over with a new set of variables.
